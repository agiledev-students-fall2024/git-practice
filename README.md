### Something of interest

Referencing [this](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338866/ai-and-the-future-of-software-development-2.html) article: 

This article explores the potential roles that AI will play in software engineering. It states that instead of replacing developers, AI will only increase their potential. For example, AI may be in charge of writing user stories and guide designers in the UI design process. As a result, developers will be free to direct their focus onto other aspects of the product or business.

I found this article interesting because it addresses a question that many developers are asking with the rise of AI. As someone early in career, it's reassuring to know that software jobs most likely won't be replaced by AI. Ultimately, using AI tools as an extension of software development—rather than a replacement—is a smart move as it allows us to create better products while giving developers time to improve other features.

* I also find this article interesting as it offers a different take from the sentiment that software developers would be replaced by AI, but rather serves as an extension of the software delivery process. It mentions that AI would instead empower the individual developer by creating a true environment of continuous delivery, by increasing efficiency through automated testing and rapid development of POCs. Overall, I find the article insightful on how we can use AI to increase our potential as developers. - Bryant To

### My thoughts - Sahar
Something I found interesting in this article is that the usage of AI in software development processes will require for more rigorous testing due to the process becoming shorter. While AI may be a bit scary at times, I find this particular usage of it to be helpful as it allows developers to focus on smaller details and perfect their design or catch bugs quicker.
