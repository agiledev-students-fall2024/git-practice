### Interesting Paragraphs
While OpenAI pursues yet another monster fundraise, it is not stealing all the oxygen in the room: AI startups building promising foundational models can still open doors, and checkbooks. Multiple sources tell us that Black Forest Labs — a startup that’s building generative AI image models and came out of stealth two months ago with $31 million in funding — is closing new funding. A $100 million round at a $1 billion valuation is the amount we are hearing. The deal may not be final and so could still be subject to change.

Black Forest is not just any AI startup: The company was co-founded by the engineers who built the technology behind Stability AI. And it has a big-name customer. Elon Musk’s X.ai is using Black Forest’s Flux.1 text-to-image model to power image generation in its Grok chatbot. That’s a service that set people chattering immediately after it was launched in part because of the audacious results people generated with it.

**Olivia YU**: Generative AI models are really profitable in commercial applications.
