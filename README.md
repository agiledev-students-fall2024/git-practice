# 'Write Code That is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Maintain'
This [article](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to) discusses the importance of prioritizing code that can be easily discarded and replaced rather than rigorously maintained. The author  makes the case that all code eventually becomes obsolete, and that trying to create 'perfect' code often leads to overcomplication and technical debt. He specifies that this problem is amplified the more consumers of an API you have, as you must manage how the code fits together in a complex and large-scale system. 

Such complications eventually become even more difficult to maintain as the project matures, indicating the importance of adaptability -- allowing parts of the system to be deleted or replaced without significant effort. However, that does not mean that developers should necessarily put in minimal effort for the greatest possible output, but moreso that they should embrace their mistakes to learn and improve their codebases over time. It highlights the critical importance of flexibility and the willingness to adapt to rapidly changing nature of the tech ecosystem.
