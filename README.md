# OpenAI Releases o1: Tackling the 'Strawberry' Problem

## My Thoughts

I found this article really interesting because it talks about OpenAI's new model, **o1**, which addresses the infamous 'Strawberry' problem in AI. This problem highlights how earlier models, like GPT-4, would mess up really simple things, such as incorrectly stating that "strawberry" has only two 'r's (instead of three) due to relying too much on pattern recognition rather than true understanding. What makes **o1** stand out is its use of reinforcement learning and a "chain of thought" process which allows it to reason through problems step by step, similar to how we do. This helps the model solve complex math puzzles and coding challenges with much better accuracyâ€”**o1** scored **83%** on the International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exams, a significant jump from GPT-4's **13%**. Although it's more expensive and slower than previous models, **o1** represents a big step toward AI systems that can reason more like humans. It could have a major impact on creating autonomous AI agents capable of solving complex problems in fields like medicine and engineering. I'm intrigued to see where this leads, especially with the **Devin.ai** team having contributed to **o1** and many fears/concerns about AI replacing software engineering jobs down the line.

### Comments

* The power of AI technology never fails to amaze me. With people working around the clock to achieve autonomous AI technology, I have no doubt that it will be reached in the near future. As the systems become more complex, the energy consumption and environmental impact increase as well. The current AI boom has led to a deficit in our energy grid. I am interested to see how the government and energy companies will adjust for AI. - Lindsey Hirano

* Really interesting article! It's really quite frightening how fast **o1** is already surpassing older models and inching even closer to replacing not just software engineers, but many other jobs too. At the end of the article, the author asks *'how do we evolve our collaboration withe AI as it evolves?'*. This got me thinking about how the education system will also change, and adapt to rapidly evolving AI teaching assistants/tools that allow for autonomous learning. - Hojong Shim

* I find this perspective on **o1** really compelling. The idea that its enhanced reasoning abilities, paired with reinforcement learning, could push AI to feel more human-like is fascinating. As **o1** continues to improve at problem-solving and performing complex tasks, it could bridge the gap that makes AI interactions feel less natural. This shift in how AI understands and processes information might reduce the disconnect people often feel when engaging with AI, making it more intuitive and relatable in everyday use.
