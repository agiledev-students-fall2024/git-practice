## Problematic AI Image Generation
["Mickey Mouse Smoking: How AI Image Tools Are Generating New Content-Moderation Problems"](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/mickey-mouse-smoking-how-ai-image-tools-are-generating-new-content-moderation-problems-da90148e?mod=ai_more_article_pos22)

As we move towards an AI driven world, we must figure out a way to regulate this new technology. The article discusses the negative consequences of unregulated AI technologies. People have found a way to manipulate AI image generators to produce photos that inaccurately depict politicians and beloved childhood characters performing inappropriate acts. As a result of how real these images look, this technology has become a concern for spreading misinformation. I am curious to see if it will play a role in this upcoming election. At this point, rules and regulations must be implemented in order to prevent more servere consequences from the AI generated images. 

### Anthony Uriarte's Thoughts

This article was really interesting to me and tackles a pressing issue on how AI tools, like **xAI’s Grok-2**, can create disturbing and misleading content w/ real-world consequences. It also brings to mind AI-generated deepfake voices, such as the case where a principal's voice was faked to spread racist content, or how scammers use it to target the elderly. With the rise of tools like OpenAI's **Sora** generating highly realistic videos, it’s clear how easily AI can be misused for manipulation and misinformation. I definitely agree that urgent regulations are needed to address these risks and prevent further harm, especially with the pressing election.

### Harrison Wong's Comment
I very much agree with your sentiment -- I think AI regulation is becoming increasingly necessary and the technology is evolving too fast but regulation is not coming about
in the proportionate speed. Actually last year I got to attend an event where a Microsoft Exec spoke in support of creating policy and regulation around AI, so it seems that
this is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed, as evidenced by your article.
